# Technical Stuff {#technical-stuff}

Since you've read this far, you already know there is a [server](#server)
automatically started and stopped for you when you use tmux. So let's go a bit
into the innards and how tmux works.

## Under the hood

There's how you use it in practice, and the hard technical reality of how something
operates under the hood.

tmux actually has really great code underneath, down to the point its a joy to
read it. You really have to thank Nicholas Marriott, Thomas Adam and Tiago Cunha
for that.

## Project basics

tmux is programmed in [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).

tmux is cross-platform. In order to allow the code base to build across a
variety of unix-like systems, [autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)
and some cool C tricks are used.

## Build system

When building from source or porting tmux to a new system, you will encounter
autotools. If this sounds complicated, do not get overwhelmed or feel you need
to understand this in one sitting. Autotools exists to abstract the painful
parts of finding libraries and checking if certain capabilities exist on a
user's system. It's solving a complicated problem, because the source code needs
to be able to build on a plethora of operating systems and individualized
environments where all of them can be a little different.

The files that make up the project build system are in [`configure.ac`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/configure.ac),
[`Makefile.am`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/Makefile.am), and the
[preprocessor directives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor#Conditional_compilation)
in [`compat.h`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/master/compat.h).

`compat.h` routes header definitions to system headers, installed libraries or
the `compat/` folder if they're not present on the system tmux is being built
on. This is done with the help of autotools' configuration process.

`autogen.sh` is the file that preps the codebase to be build via the `make`
command.

1. Creates an `etc/` directory
2. Runs [`aclocal`](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/aclocal-Invocation.html)
   to generate [`aclocal.m4`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1970926/whats-the-point-of-aclocal).
3. `automake` will use `Makefile.am` to generate `Makefile.in`
4. `autoreconf` to generate `./configure` script
5. `./configure` checks system settings against compiler features, libraries,
   headers, etc. the project needs and (if necessary) features the user specified
   such as building with `DEBUG` flags.

## Event passing

The innards of tmux is powered by [libevent](http://libevent.org/), a cross-platform event
notification library. libevent is an abstraction layer on top of OS-specific event notifiers.

It's the workhorse behind the scenes. It's used in software like Chromium,
Memcached, Transmission and Tor.
