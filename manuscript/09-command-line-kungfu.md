# Command Line Kung fu {#cli-kung-fu}

The command line in tmux is one of those areas often uncharted.

## Shorthands

tmux commands and arguments may all be accessed via [`fnmatch(3)`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fnmatch.html)
patterns.

For instance, you don't need to type `$ tmux attach` every time. `$ tmux attac`,
`$ tmux att`, `$ tmux at` and `$ tmux a` work just as well.

Every tmux command has shorthands, let's try this for `$ tmux new-session`:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
    $ tmux new-session

    $ tmux new-sessio

    # ...

    $ tmux new-s

and so on, until:

{language=shell, line-numbers=off}
    $ tmux new-
    ambiguous command: new-, could be: new-session, new-window

## Targets {#targets}

If a command allows target specification, it's usually done through `-t`.

Think of targets as tmux's way of specifying a [unique key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_key)
in a relational database.

| Entity    | Prefix | Example                               |
|-----------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| server    | n/a    | n/a, uses socket-name and socket-path |
| session   | $      | $13                                   |
| window    | @      | @2313                                 |
| pane      | %      | %5432                                 |

What I use to help me remember:

So sessions are represented by dollar signs ($), because those are where you keep
your projects (*ostensibly* where you make money, or help someone else do it).

Windows are represented by the [at sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_sign)
(@). So windows are kind of like referencing / messaging a user on a social
networking website.

Panes are the fun one, represented by the percent sign (%). Just like the
default prompt for [csh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell) and
[tcsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh). Hey, makes sense, since panes are
your pseudoterminals.

To give you an idea of the possibilities of where you can use targets, here are
the commands with you can use targets:

- `$ tmux attach-session [-t target-session]`
- `$ tmux detach-client [-s target-session] [-t target-client]`
- `$ tmux has-session [-t target-session]`
- `$ tmux kill-session [-t target-session]`
- `$ tmux list-clients [-t target-session]`
- `$ tmux lock-client [-t target-client]`
- `$ tmux lock-session [-t target-session]`

## Formats {#formats}

tmux provides a minimal template language and set of variables you can use to
access information about your tmux environment.

Formats are often specified via `-F` flag.

You know how template engines such as
[mustache](https://mustache.github.io/), 
[handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and 
[ERB](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html) in Ruby,
[jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) in Python,
[twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) in PHP, and
[JSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages) in Java allow template
variables? Formats are a similar concept.

The amount of `FORMATS` (variables) made available by tmux has expanded greatly
since version 1.8.
